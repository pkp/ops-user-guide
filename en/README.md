# OPS 3.0 User Guide

This guide will help you to manage the posting of preprint research papers using Open Preprint Server.


When you see **Help** links within the application, they'll open a help panel with the most useful information for that section.

A more detailed look at this software is available in [Learning OPS 3](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ops/en/).
