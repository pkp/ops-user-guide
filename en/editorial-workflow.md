The editorial workflow in OPS is simple compared to that of a journal. When a preprint is submitted it is immediately in the Production stage and Production is the only stage in the workflow.

For more information, see [Learning OJS 3: Editorial Workflow](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ops/en/editorial-workflow).

## <a name="moderation-and-production"></a>Moderation and Production

When a preprint is submitted it is immediately in the Production stage and Production is the only stage in the workflow. Depending on your configuration either the Preprint Server Manager or Moderations will receive a notification when a new submission has been received.  

### <a name="Activity-log"></a>Activity log

Add notes for record-keeping and view a log of all events associated with this submission. Only server team and administrative staff have access to the Activity log.

### <a name="submission-library"></a>Library

A quick-access repository for any files that you'd like to track along with the submission. This is useful for files that aren't specific to any stage, such as signed contracts, marketing files, or guidelines you'd like to share with copyeditors or other assistants.

You can quickly add files from your [Publisher Library](settings/workflow-settings#publisher) by clicking on **View Document Library**.

### <a name="Workflow"></a>Workflow

At the Production stage, the Preprint Server Manager or Moderator can create discussions, assign participants, and record their decision.

### <a name="Preprint"></a>Preprint
View and revise the submission metadata.

## <a name="editorial-actions"></a> Editorial Actions

There are two possible editorial decisions, which are ‘Decline Submission’ or ‘Post the preprint’. Selecting ‘Decline Submission” will open a pop-up with the option to notify the author(s) or not, and selecting ‘Post the preprint’ will move the user to the Publication tab.

It is also possible to revert a ‘Decline Submission’ Decision. This can be done by clicking ‘Change Decision’ after you have recorded a Decline decision followed by Revert Decline.

## <a name="participants"></a>Participants

On the right of each stage of the workflow, you'll find a list of users who have access to submission. It’s possible to add a new participant to the submission by selecting the ‘Assign’ button. 

When assigning a moderator it’s possible to allow for them to view and edit submission metadata (this option is selected by default) and/or to only recommend an editorial decision, in which case a Server Manager or another Moderator needs to record the decision to either post or decline the submission.
