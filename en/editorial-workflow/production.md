# Moderation and Publication

Once a new submission has been received, the the system will send the Preprint Server a notification. A Moderator can be manually assigned to the submission or the system may automatically do so if it has been configured in the Server Settings.

1. [Moderation](production#moderation)
2. [Publication](production#publication)

## <a name="moderation"></a>Moderation

### <a name="moderator"></a>Assigning Moderators

To assign a Moderator select the 'Assign' button under the Participant list.

### <a name="discussion"></a>Discussion

If the Moderator wants to ask the author a question or have a discussion with the author, another moderator, the Preprint Server Manager, or another participant in the submission, they can 'Add a Discussion' in the Production Discussions.

###  <a name="decision"></a>Recording Decision

There are two possible editorial decisions, which are ‘Decline Submission’ or ‘Post the preprint’. Selecting ‘Decline Submission” will open a pop-up with the option to notify the author(s) or not, and selecting ‘Post the preprint’ will move the user to the Preprint tab.

In OPS 3.3 it is possible to revert a ‘Decline Submission’ Decision. This can be done by clicking ‘Change Decision’ after you have recorded a Decline decision followed by Revert Decline.

## <a name="publication"></a>Publication

The Preprint tab contains the submission’s metadata and galleys. A Galley is a final publication-ready file that has been prepared for readers and will be posted on the preprint site.

For more information on the tabs and options available, please refer to the [Publication tabs](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/production-publication#publication-tabs) section of the Learning OJS guide.

### Preprint Status

There are three possible Relations statuses for a published preprint. Only the bottom two relational status will appear on the abstract page if selected.

* Preprint has not been submitted for publication;
* Preprint has been submitted for publication in a journal; or
* Preprint has been published in a journal as an article.

Submission statuses can be updated even after a Preprint has been posted, either by a Moderator or an Author.

For more information on Preprint Status, please refer to the [Preprint Status](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ops/en/editorial-workflow#preprint-status) section of the Learing OPS guide.

### Publishing New Versions 

Since preprints can change significantly between versions, it is important to post and clearly identify all versions of a preprint. OPS allows you to post different versions of an article and display all of the versions on the posted article page.

By default, only Server Managers can create new versions of a posted preprint. The ‘Create New Version’ button is available next to the ‘Unpublish.’

Clicking ‘Create New Version’ will open a pop-up asking if you are sure you’d like to create a new version. It’s important to note that, once a new version is created, it’s not possible to delete it.

For more information on versioning and editing a posted preprint, please refer to the [Publishing New Versions](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ops/en/editorial-workflow#publishing-new-versions) section of the Learning OPS guide.
