## <a name="license"></a>License
Here you can configure copyright and permissions on a server level. You will also be able to enter copyright and permissions information on an manuscript when it is posted.

The **copyright** identifies the author or owner of copyright for a published work. For example, Copyright (c) 2016 by Jane Smith.

The **license** attached to a work will determine the usage rights for the published work. For example, CC-By 4.0 allows the work to be copied, redistributed, and adapted for any purpose, even commercially, as long as attribution is given to the copyright holder.
