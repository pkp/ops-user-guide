In Server Settings you can configure information about the Press, including preprint server team, contacts, sections (if applicable), and categories for published content. See [Learning OPS: Setting Up and Maintaining Your Server](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/journal-setup) for detailed instructions.

## <a name="masthead"></a>Masthead
Under Masthead enter information about your Preprint Server. Some of the information will automatically be displayed on pages of your Servers's website.

## <a name="contact"></a>Contact
What you fill in for Contact tells users how to contact your Server. The Principal Contact is the automatic sender and receiver for some automated emails.

## <a name="sections"></a>Sections
Sections are not used in OPS the way they are used in OJS because in OPS you do not publish issues and posted preprints are not organized by sections. Sections can be used to classify preprints in different disciplines or document types.

## <a name="categories"></a>Categories
Categories can be used to classify preprints in different disciplines of knowledge. Unlike sections, there can be multiple categories associated with a submission/preprint.
