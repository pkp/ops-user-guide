In Website Settings you can configure the appearance of and information on your reader-facing website, set up your site's languages and archiving settings, and install and enable plugins. As the Website Settings in OPS is similar to OJS, see [Learning OJS 3: Website Settings](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/settings-website) for detailed information on these settings. There may be additional tabs in this menu if you have enabled specific plugins, such as Static Pages or Translator.
