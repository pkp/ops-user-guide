## <a name="submission"></a>Submission
The Submission tab determines what information authors provide or agree to when they make a submission.

### Disable Submissions
If you want to disable submissions for the whole server you can check the box here. 

### Metadata
If you Enable a metadata field it will be available for each submission. Checking **Submission Form** will allow authors to add it when they make a submission. Otherwise only an editor will be able to add it.

### Components
Components are types of files that can be included with a submission.  You can add new components or edit or delete the default components. Components can be configured as supplementary or dependent, which determines how or whether they are published.

### Checklist
Provide authors with a checklist of tasks they should complete before completing their submission. This is a good place to indicate requirements for referencing, font size, line spacing, document format, and more.

### Author Guidelines
Author Guidelines will be shown to authors when they make a submission.

## <a name="publisher"></a>Publisher Library
The Publisher Library provides a file repository for storing and quickly sharing common files, such as writing guidelines, author contracts and release forms, and marketing materials.

Items that are stored in the Publisher Library can be quickly retrieved and added into a [Submission Library](../editorial-workflow#submission-library) to be shared with authors or assistants.

## <a name="emails"></a>Emails
OPS has a number of email templates that are sent automatically such as the submission ackowledgement, password and sent manually. The settings in this section allow you to edit the signature attached to each email as well as change the default messages sent for each type of email.

You can view a description of each email and edit the email by clicking the dropdown arrow on the right.
