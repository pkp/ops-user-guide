Manage your servers's users, assign them to roles, and create or edit existing roles. For more detailed information, see [Learning OPS 3: Users and Roles](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ops/en/users-roles).

## <a name="users"></a> Users

Preprint Server Managers and Administrators can view a list of all users in the server. You can add users, disable a user, send them email, edit their profile, or remove all roles they have with the server.

The easiest way to find a user is to use the search button, which will allow you to search by name or role.

*To find a list of all authors, use the Search feature, leave the search field empty and select Author from the dropdown menu. Then click the Search button.*

## <a name="roles"></a> Roles

User roles govern who can access what in the server.

A flexible user role system is provided so that you can tailor the roles to your needs. On the Roles tab, you'll see a list of default roles created by the system.

You can edit or remove existing roles or add new roles. All roles are given one of a few permission levels which allow them to perform various actions in the system:

- *Authors* can make new submissions.
- *Readers*, like all other user types, can access the reader-facing website. All users have this capability.
- *Preprint Server Manager* have access to the entire [Editorial Workflow](editorial-workflow), as well as most of the settings.
- *Moderators* can access only those parts of the [Editorial Workflow](editorial-workflow) assigned to their role (see below).

In OPS, the Preprint Server Manager can grant access to allow authors and Moderators to make metadata changes prior to the manuscript being posted. For more information, see [Learning OPS: Granting Author permissions](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ops/en/users-roles#granting-author-permissions)

## <a name="site-access"></a> Site Access Options

Under the Site Access tab, you can turn off public user registration or event limit access to the reader-facing site to registered users.
